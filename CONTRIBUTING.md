### Development Environment

There is really not much too it. As long as you have some experience with:
 - [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) (there is a great tutorial repository [ahmadawais/lerna-tutorial](https://github.com/ahmadawais/lerna-tutorial))
 - [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces)
 
After you fork this repository, all you have to do is run:

```
yarn install
```

Now you can party ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ and do some work. ðŸ™Œ

### Guidelines

Please, don't skip git hooks:

- we all have to use [conventional commit messages](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) for semantic release to work
- we all have to fix eslint errors before we commit new changes

**Thank you for considering your help to this repository.** ðŸ˜Š
